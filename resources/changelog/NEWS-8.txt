Notes on individual issues:
===========================

hotspot/jfr:

JDK-8240687: JDK Flight Recorder Integrated to OpenJDK 8u
=========================================================

OpenJDK 8u now contains the backport of JEP 328: Flight Recorder
(https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/328) from later versions of OpenJDK.

JFR is a low-overhead framework to collect and provide data helpful to
troubleshoot the performance of the OpenJDK runtime and of Java
applications. It consists of a new API to define custom events under
the jdk.jfr namespace and a JMX interface to interact with the
framework. The recording can also be initiated with the application
startup using the -XX:+FlightRecorder flag or via jcmd. JFR replaces
the +XX:EnableTracing feature introduced in JEP 167, providing a more
efficient way to retrieve the same information. For compatibility
reasons, +XX:EnableTracing is still accepted, however no data will be
printed.

While JFR is not built by default upstream, it is included in Red Hat
binaries for supported architectures (x86_64, AArch64 & PowerPC 64)

hotspot/runtime:

JDK-8205622: JFR Start Failure After AppCDS Archive Created with JFR StartFlightRecording
=========================================================================================

JFR will be disabled with a warning message if it is enabled during
CDS dumping. The user will see the following warning message:

OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM warning: JFR will be disabled during CDS dumping

if JFR is enabled during CDS dumping such as in the following command
line:

$ java -Xshare:dump -XX:StartFlightRecording=dumponexit=true

security-libs/java.security:

JDK-8244167: Removal of Comodo Root CA Certificate
==================================================

The following expired Comodo root CA certificate was removed from the
`cacerts` keystore: + alias name "addtrustclass1ca [jdk]"

Distinguished Name: CN=AddTrust Class 1 CA Root, OU=AddTrust TTP Network, O=AddTrust AB, C=SE

JDK-8244166: Removal of DocuSign Root CA Certificate
====================================================

The following expired DocuSign root CA certificate was removed from
 the `cacerts` keystore: + alias name "keynectisrootca [jdk]"

Distinguished Name: CN=KEYNECTIS ROOT CA, OU=ROOT, O=KEYNECTIS, C=FR

security-libs/javax.crypto:pkcs11:

JDK-8240191: Allow SunPKCS11 initialization with NSS when external FIPS modules are present in the Security Modules Database
============================================================================================================================

The SunPKCS11 security provider can now be initialized with NSS when
FIPS-enabled external modules are configured in the Security Modules
Database (NSSDB). Prior to this change, the SunPKCS11 provider would
throw a RuntimeException with the message: "FIPS flag set for
non-internal module" when such a library was configured for NSS in
non-FIPS mode.

This change allows the JDK to work properly with recent NSS releases
on GNU/Linux operating systems when the system-wide FIPS policy is
turned on.

Further information can be found in JDK-8238555.

Notes on individual issues:
===========================

hotspot/svc:

JDK-8174881: Binary format for HPROF updated 
============================================

When dumping the heap in binary format, HPROF format 1.0.2 is always
used now. Previously, format 1.0.1 was used for heaps smaller than
2GB. HPROF format 1.0.2 is also used by jhsdb jmap for the
serviceability agent.

security-libs/java.security:

JDK-8229518: Added Support for PKCS#1 v2.2 Algorithms Including RSASSA-PSS Signature
====================================================================================

The SunRsaSign and SunJCE providers have been enhanced with support
for more algorithms defined in PKCS#1 v2.2, such as RSASSA-PSS
signature and OAEP using FIPS 180-4 digest algorithms. New
constructors and methods have been added to relevant JCA/JCE classes
under the `java.security.spec` and `javax.crypto.spec` packages for
supporting additional RSASSA-PSS parameters.

security-libs/javax.crypto:

JDK-8205471: RSASSA-PSS Signature Support Added to SunMSCAPI
============================================================

The RSASSA-PSS signature algorithm support has been added to the SunMSCAPI provider.

security-libs/javax.security:

JDK-8227564: Allow SASL Mechanisms to Be Restricted
===================================================

A security property named `jdk.sasl.disabledMechanisms` has been added
that can be used to disable SASL mechanisms. Any disabled mechanism
will be ignored if it is specified in the `mechanisms` argument of
`Sasl.createSaslClient` or the `mechanism` argument of
`Sasl.createSaslServer`. The default value for this security property
is empty, which means that no mechanisms are disabled out-of-the-box.
